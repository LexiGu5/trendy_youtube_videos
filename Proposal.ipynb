    "YouTube is the most popular platform for people to share and view original contents. It has more than 2 billion users, with one billion hours and 5 billion videos watched daily. From a content-creator perspective, a trending YouTube video with tons of views, likes, and comments could be super lucrative. Given the increasing consumption of original videos and potential revenues, I would like to examine what would make a YouTube video popular. Specifically, I would like to look at the category, trending date, publish date, and video descriptions. Additionally, I would like to analyze the difference in trends and determinants across videos created in the US and videos created in the UK."

    "YouTube has a list of the top trending videos on the platform. Kaggle has released a dataset of daily record of the top trending videos on YouTube, using the list on YouTube as a reference. I plan to use the dataset for the trending US YouTube videos and the dataset for the trending UK YouTube videos. For reference, this is the link to the US trending YouTube video dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset?select=US_youtube_trending_data.csv"

In the dataset, the category id is coded with numbers ranging from 1 to 31 for the US dataset and from 1 to 30 for the UK dataset. I will also use these two json files along with the datasets to identify the category names associated with the category numbers.

I think all of the variables are important and useful for me to conduct the analysis. Also, I limit my analysis on videos released in August, September, and October this year. "

I would merge the two data sets on publish time. 3) I plan to change the string-type publish time and the trending date as pandas datetime objects. 4) I will then define a function to calculate the difference in days between the publish time and the trending date. 5) I plan to filter the dataset by selecting the columns of interest. 6) I plan to group the observations by variables of interest (such as category and publish date) for further analysis.

    "For visualizations, 1) I would like to have one bar chart of videos across all tags appeared in the videos to visualize what tag/category appears the most in the trending videos. I would like to know which tag is most likely to make a video trending. 2) I would like to have a line chart for the daily total number of trending videos, using trending date as the x variable, to analyze if there is a specific time that has the most trending videos. In other words, is there a time that is more favorable for YouTubers to publish videos.  3) I would like to have a scatter plot for total number of trending videos and time, using the categories as the filled value. I would like to use this graph to analyze what category stands out at what date. 4) I would like to create another scatter plot for total number of views across all categories to examine which category would be the most popular one.

    "I think a successful project needs to meet three requirements. First, the project has a clear structure. The project needs to be divided into several parts, such as obtaining data, data wrangling, visualization, etc. Each section needs to have a clear explanation of what the author tries to achieve, and there should be sufficient comments for each code. Second, the final dataset should be clean. Useless columns should be removed. The observations are structured/grouped in a way that the author specified earlier. The dataset should be ready to use for replication of analysis. Third, all of the visualizations should be of publishable quality. It is important for readers to understand the graph by itself and the results shown on the graph should be easy to understand. "
